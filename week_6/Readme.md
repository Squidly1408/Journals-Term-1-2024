###The stated benefits of diverse workplaces according to SBS
For people to reach their true potential, they must first feel free to live and work as their authentic selves. An inclusive workplace encourages this, by fostering an environment where individuals are empowered to speak up, contribute their ideas, have equal opportunity to succeed, and pursue a career free of limitations. Inclusive workplaces support a more engaged team and productive space for people to work and as a result, these workplaces perform better than their less inclusive counterparts. 

###How does SBS engage with and support diverse groups?
At the core of SBS’s Inclusion, Equity & Diversity Strategy are our Employee Advisory Groups (EAG), empowering our people to take an active role in fostering an inclusive culture for all.

Current groups include:

First Nations Staff Advisory Group, focused on the experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees.

SBS Multi, focused on multicultural and multifaith inclusion.

SBS Access, focused on the experiences of employees with disabilities.

The Network, focused on gender equity.

SBS Pride & Allies, focused on LGBTQI+ inclusion.

Each group works with external experts to inform their strategies and approach, and come together every eight weeks, in a meeting chaired by the SBS Managing Director, known as the SBS Inclusion Council. Each group shares updates on activities, contributes proposals for the development and delivery of the Inclusion, Equity & Diversity Strategy, and the outcomes from this meeting are shared with SBS employees.

Fundamental to the EAG model, and our commitment to inclusion at SBS, are principles which ensure that intersectional perspectives are included in internal events, initiatives and activities, that the groups themselves are diverse and that any employee, regardless of background or identity, may participate fully.

###Does SBS have initiatives to employ and engage Aboriginal communities, organisations and individuals?
Our Indigenous Employment Strategy is focused on developing First Nations talent, and we have partnered with Career Trackers to offer intern placements to Indigenous university students.

Inspiring long-term shifts in the sector, SBS and NITV’s Beyond 3% initiative launched in 2021 aims to raise awareness of the benefits of greater advertising investment by media agencies and brands in Australia’s Indigenous media platforms.

SBS, NITV and Reconciliation Australia also proudly partner together for the Reconciliation Film Club. This online platform supports organisations to host screenings of a curated selection of documentaries from Australia's leading Indigenous film makers to help ignite conversations and spark change. Learn more.

With programs that inspire, instil pride and lead to a greater understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and cultures, NITV helps all Australians to connect with our rich Indigenous history.

###How does SBS promote stronger engagement with countries and people from the Asia region?
