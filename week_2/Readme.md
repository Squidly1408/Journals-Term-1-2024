## LTI Task
Work and employment are crucial when developing and shaping the economics of countries, but how do they shape the Australian economy? 
Before we can answer the question, how does work and employment shape the Australian economy? We need to ask ourselves what is work and employment? Well, the term work by definition of the Cambridge dictionary means “an activity, such as a job, that a person uses physical or mental effort to do, usually for money.” (Cambridge Dictionary - https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/work - 06/02/2024). Although this is a great starting point to define work and employment this definition accompanies many forms of work from small to large, from doing chores for money to being employed, and can only form one side of our question. The other side of our question is to ask ourselves what is employment? Which the Reserve Bank of Australia can give us a clue. They mention that to be considered employed, you will need to be in a paid job for one or more hours per week. (Reserve Bank of Australia - https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/explainers/unemployment-its-measurement-and-types.html#:~:text=Employed%20%E2%80%93%20includes%20people%20who%20are,are%20actively%20looking%20for%20work. – 06/02/2024). This helps us gain an understanding of what employment is however, it still leaves some questions unanswered like; what types of employment are there? Well employment can come in diverse forms such as part time; full time; casual; fixed term contract employment; shift workers; daily hire; weekly hire; probation; apprenticeships & traineeships; outworking (Fairwork.gov.au - https://www.fairwork.gov.au/starting-employment/types-of-employees - 06/02/2024).

Now that we answered the question what is work and employment we can move to the next question, how does employment and work shape the economy? 
There are a few ways that it can shape the economy from economic contribution to social cohesion. The economic contribution that workers and employees provide is a key factor in Australia’s output, for example, Newcastle’s port has traded 170.4 million tonnes of goods in 2016 / 17 (The port of Newcastle - https://www.portofnewcastle.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ECO-011-Port-of-Newcastle_Economic-Impact-Report_V4-_-SK_v6.pdf - 06/02/2024) and in doing so has boosted the economy and provided a boost to other sectors of the economy, all done by the employees and workers. Another way employment and work shape the economy through economic contribution is, the labour force participation rate, reflecting the proportion of the working-age population engaged in work or actively seeking employment.
Employment also contributes to the income distribution of Australia, influencing the overall socio-economic well-being of the population while also contributing to the social stability of Australia, reducing poverty, improving Australia’s community and welfare.

So in conclusion, work and employment shape Australia’s economy through many means such as social cohesion and economic contribution, boosting The labour force rate and increasing Australia’s socio-economic well-being.

## Song annotation - Six Pills
I have chosen a song called “Six Pills”. It is a song that describes a person meeting an old man ‘a man old as oak and staff in hand sunken eyes, but gentle smile.’  who gives him a cure to all his problems in the form of a pill where it is said ‘One to numb the hurt, two to ease the pain, three to clear your mind, forget all the hate, take as I advised, not more than prescribed, several weeks ahead, you'll be fine again.’ However, as the time goes on with these magical pills he forgets what the old man says and starts to fight addiction to this “perfect cure.” 
This is a sad song about how there is no perfect cure to things, and easily it can be addicting to rely on something we perceive as a cure.
