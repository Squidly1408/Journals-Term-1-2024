##Morning
I arrived at SAPHI and got stuck into labeling signs for AI. its quite mundane but anyway. also turns out I stole someone's desk they usually sit at, I kind of wish I had my own desk that I can customize, get a desk mat, bring in my own keyboard and mouse that I can keep here, however if I do it wont be a while because when I leave school my ideal is a part time job at SAPHI not a full time job. 


##midday
I just finished lunch although I wasn't eating because I forgot my lunch today but I did enjoy it, and spending time with the team at SAPHI. I'm going back to annotating images for AI, which is a important thing so SAPHI can get an AI ready to read data for a clients job. TBH I can't wait until I am Back at home though. I also sent out emails to the people who gave me potential job offers so I can learn more about the offers and how I should layout my future. I am also wanting to create a website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so i can develop my skills and prove that i know the language.
