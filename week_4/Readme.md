 - participate in more Check-ins and Check-outs

# Free Journal - Wednesday Journal
####I am working on improving my resume and have contacted a mentor from SAPHI engineering to look over my resume, this is what they said:

Hey Mate,

I think your two most powerful components are your experience and your projects. I’d get them on the first page. A single line showing level of education is also handy. I like that you have your portfolio link in there as I reckon it’s awesome. 

You could separate computer skill into skills and tools? Put all the programming languages and frameworks in one section (python, JavaScript, html, flutter etc) and tools in another (git, GitHub, word, excel).

List of soft skills are good to have but I don’t think they need to be the first thing you see as I’d be looking to gauge soft skills from interviews and initial work period. 

Can you get it to one page by using columns?

# Journal Task - Friday Journal - renewable resources
“The future is green energy, sustainability, renewable energy.” – Arnold Schwarzenegger [1], We have known about non-renewable energy and the impact it can have on our futures and the futures of our children for a long time, like climate change since 1896 [2] we continue to use resources that are non-renewable, or finite, these are sources of energy like coal, oil, natural gases, and other mined resources [3]. While this is a worldwide situation that we need to find a solution to together, Australia has a long journey before it mainly relies on renewable energy, currently the energy that Australia uses is found by using fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gases [4], these energy sources will run out and when they do they will leave a major gap in the energy that Australia needs which will cause the prices of electricity and power to skyrocket [5]. However if we switch to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, ocean, and bioenergy [6] we will limit the impact the human race has on our eco system, we can build a future for us and our children, and we can expect to continue to thrive.
