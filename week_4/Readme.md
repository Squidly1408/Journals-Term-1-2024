# Free Journal - Wednesday Journal
####I am working on improving my resume and have contacted a mentor from SAPHI engineering to look over my resume, this is what they said:

Hey Mate,

I think your two most powerful components are your experience and your projects. I’d get them on the first page. A single line showing level of education is also handy. I like that you have your portfolio link in there as I reckon it’s awesome. 

You could separate computer skill into skills and tools? Put all the programming languages and frameworks in one section (python, JavaScript, html, flutter etc) and tools in another (git, GitHub, word, excel).

List of soft skills are good to have but I don’t think they need to be the first thing you see as I’d be looking to gauge soft skills from interviews and initial work period. 

Can you get it to one page by using columns?
